# NETFLIX-MOVIE-AND-TV-SHOWS-CLUSTERING
About the Project 

This project is all about recommending a variety of movies and TV shows to viewers, which are
managed by the Netflix company. The platform streams the media online. Subscribers can choose
between monthly plans and yearly plans based on how much they want to watch Netflix
simultaneously.

Problem Statement:

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected
from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.
In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has
nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than
2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to
explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.



In this project, you are required to do

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Understanding what type content is available in different countries
3. Is Netflix increasingly focused on TV rather than movies in recent years?
4. Clustering similar content by matching text-based features.

#### Apply Different clustering Algorithms.
1. Silhouette score
2. Elbow Method
3. DBSCAN


#### Conclusion

1. The majority of the Netflix content is movies, making it an interesting discovery.
2. There are two different forms of material in this dataset: movies (69.14%) and TV shows (30.86%).
3. We may infer from the dataset insights that the most TV shows were released in 2017, and the most movies were published in 2020.
4. But it has increasingly been concentrating more on television shows.
5. Among the top 5 countries that create all of the content that is made available on the site are the United States and India.
6. In fact, six of the top ten actors with the most content are Indian.
7. In text analysis (NLP) I used stop words, removed punctuations , stemming & TF-IDF vectorizer and other functions of NLP.
8. k=10 was found to be an optimal value for clusters using which we grouped our data into 10 distinct clusters.
9. In text analysis (NLP) I used stop words, removed punctuations , stemming & TF-IDF vectorizer and other functions of NLP.


#Future Scope

1. Many exciting discoveries can be obtained by combining this dataset with other external datasets, such as IMDB ratings and rotten fruit.
2. A better recommender system might be developed with more time and then put online for users to use.
